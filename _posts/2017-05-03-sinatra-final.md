When it was all said and done, I feel like I accomplished a lot. I'm a big fantasy football player, so I built a system to organize users with their teams and players. The biggest challenge occurred when I had to assign each player a `team_id`. I had trouble getting the params organized the way I'd like to make that happen automatically. I had to re-work a few things, but in the end, I got it working the way I'd like.
