title: "Sinatra Final Project"
---

I enjoyed working on this project. For the first time with this Sinatra final project, I felt like I was truly working like a software engineer. I had to build things from the ground up. I wasn't given file structure, I wasn't given pre-filled code, and I wasn't given a topic. I had to think clearly to be able to structure and organize my files and my code itself. It was a challenge!

When it was all said and done, I feel like I accomplished a lot. I'm a big fantasy football player, so I built a system to organize users with their teams and players. The biggest challenge occurred when I had to assign each player a `team_id`. I had trouble getting the params organized the way I'd like to make that happen automatically. I had to re-work a few things, but in the end, I got it working the way I'd like. I imagine that's the type of trial and error process I'll run into when I get a real software engineering job. I'm looking forward to it.
